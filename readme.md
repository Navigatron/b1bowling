# B1Bowling

Who's good at bowling?

Bowling night is once week. There are many games per night.

Over the course of a night, some players get worse, and some get better.

To capture a good average, the leaderboard is calculated on two weeks of games,
regardless of how many games occur in those two weeks.

Players with no data in the last two weeks are removed from the leaderboard.
